"Falls ihr heute mit der Disziplin ringt. Es ist ganz normal. Disziplin wird Stück für Stück aufgebaut, nicht über Nacht geschenkt. Es ist entscheidend, dem Kopf klarzumachen, dass das, was wir tun, seinen Wert hat. Und vergesst nicht: Belohnt euch regelmäßig für die kleinen Siege, damit ihr nicht das Gefühl bekommt, eure Anstrengungen seien umsonst. Nur so bleibt ihr dran und werft nicht alles hin. Es geht darum, den Unterschied zu erkennen zwischen dem, was wir sofort wollen, und dem, was uns langfristig am Herzen liegt.

"📅 Kalendar Puasa: April 2025 | Syawal 1447 H

Assalamualaikum semua! Berikut adalah tarikh-tarikh untuk melaksanakan ibadah puasa sunat sepanjang bulan Syawal 🤗

🌼 Puasa Sunat Isnin: 7,21,28 April
🌼 Puasa Sunat Khamis: 3,10,17,24 April
🌼 Puasa Hari Putih: 12,13,14 April

🌸Daripada Abu Ayyub al-Ansari RA, Rasulullah SAW bersabda:

مَنْ صَامَ رَمَضَانَ ثُمَّ أَتْبَعَهُ سِتًّا مِنْ شَوَّالٍ كَانَ كَصِيَامِ الدَّهْرِ

Maksudnya: Sesiapa yang berpuasa pada bulan Ramadan kemudian diikuti dengan enam hari pada bulan Syawal, ianya bersamaan dengan berpuasa sepanjang tahun.

Riwayat Muslim (1164)

Marilah kita memperbanyakkan berpuasa sunat dan semoga amal ibadah kita diterima oleh Allah SWT.

"At last, Ramadan is finally here ! 🌙✨ Ramadan is a time of reflection, self-discipline, and strengthening our connection with Allah. It’s a month of trials, where we challenge our nafs and purify our hearts through patience, prayer, and good deeds. Let's make use of this holy month to become the better version of ourselves. 🤍

يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ

“O you who have believed, fasting has been prescribed upon you as it was prescribed upon those before you that you may attain taqwa (piety).” (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:183)
