"母亲节🌷致敬平凡中的伟大🌷

母亲，是世界上最温柔且坚韧的角色。✨她们用岁月诠释无私，以行动守护家庭。母爱无需华丽辞藻，它早已深深植于我们生命的点滴之中。

在这特别的日子里，多媒体大学（赛城）华文学会谨向全天下的母亲致以最崇高的敬意与谢意。🥰

愿所有母亲健康平安、笑容常在，岁月温柔待你，正如你温柔待我们。

💓母亲节快乐💓

Mother’s Day🌷Honouring Greatness in the Ordinary🌷

A mother embodies both gentleness and strength. ✨ Through time, she teaches us selflessness,and through quiet sacrifice, she holds families together. Motherly love needs no grand declaration, it is found in every small moment, every silent act of care.

On this meaningful occasion, the Chinese Language Society Multimedia University (Cyberjaya) extends its deepest respect and gratitude to all mothers.🥰

May all mothers be blessed with good health, lasting joy,and the warmth they have so selflessly given to others.

💓Happy Mother’s Day💓",0,0

"Falls ihr heute mit der Disziplin ringt. Es ist ganz normal. Disziplin wird Stück für Stück aufgebaut, nicht über Nacht geschenkt. Es ist entscheidend, dem Kopf klarzumachen, dass das, was wir tun, seinen Wert hat. Und vergesst nicht: Belohnt euch regelmäßig für die kleinen Siege, damit ihr nicht das Gefühl bekommt, eure Anstrengungen seien umsonst. Nur so bleibt ihr dran und werft nicht alles hin. Es geht darum, den Unterschied zu erkennen zwischen dem, was wir sofort wollen, und dem, was uns langfristig am Herzen liegt.

你是否曾有遗憾，久久无法释怀？🌱
后悔没说出口的那句话，
走错的学业道路，
还是未曾道别的那个人？

我们都有遗憾，但这些是否真的注定无法释怀？佛法告诉我们，忏悔不是否定过去，而是开启改变的钥匙。🪷

在这个特别的夜晚，欢迎你来分享或静静聆听，一起透过佛法中的忏悔与成长，走向更轻盈的自己。✨
